    <h1>StrudleOS devlog</h1>
    <p>I installed Glued3D as an app on Strudle OS go to the GitHub repo for a video of me doing it.</p>
    <p>fixed boot log errors and worked on an encrytion system</p>
    <p>removed loading moon and created the StrudleOS command prompt app also added @#electron setup command to setup file storage on electron builds note:for electron builds to properly store files you need to have node.js installed on your computer this is a no dangerousc software that will allow apps to silently download read and store files the reason i'm using this is to hide the host OS when using StrudleOS</p>
    <p>created SHAP packager and worked on window resize commands as well as window fullscreen</p>
    <p>upgraded devlog background, what do you think?</p>
