    <h1>StrudleOS devlog</h1>
    <p>I have added a way to close apps without FCC you simply press "C" while holding your mouse on the black outline around the app</p>
    <p>Released the first betatest electron app to install apps you need to use @#electron install then select the .sha (strudle html app) file from your computer this is because the penguinmod http extention dosn't allow bigger apps. to setup the file save system make sure you have node.js installed and setup then create a file called StrudleOS.dat copy the filepath then use @#electron steup and past the filepath in the prompt box if this dose not work contact fidgetboyrolly</p>
    <p>I made significant progress to the Strudle "app store" but due to fetch limitaions I cannot allow bigger apps to be installed woth github I will soon find a way around this</p>
    <p>setup a simple app-to-OS communication system and created the app store</p>
    <p>I installed Glued3D as an app on Strudle OS go to the GitHub repo for a video of me doing it.</p>
    <p>fixed boot log errors and worked on an encrytion system</p>
    <p>removed loading moon and created the StrudleOS command prompt app also added @#electron setup command to setup file storage on electron builds note:for electron builds to properly store files you need to have node.js installed on your computer this is a no dangerousc software that will allow apps to silently download read and store files the reason i'm using this is to hide the host OS when using StrudleOS</p>
    <p>created SHAP packager and worked on window resize commands as well as window fullscreen</p>
    <p>upgraded devlog background, what do you think?</p>
